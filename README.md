# Fetch js

Reliably fetch scripts and execute callbacks once evaluated

It really is just that, but you know, cross browser testing etc.

Works in all browsers that support [Promises](http://caniuse.com/#feat=promises). 

## usage
```js
var fetchJs = require('fetch-js')

fetchJs('http://mycdn.com/hulu-js-frameworks/cheese.js').then(function(){
  //use the cheese!
}).catch(function (err) {
  //handle the error
})
```

## run tests
```js
npm test
```

This project was created by the Engineering team at Qubit. As we use open source libraries, we make our projects public where possible.

We’re currently looking to grow our team, so if you’re a JavaScript engineer and keen on ES2016 React+Redux applications and Node micro services, why not get in touch? Work with like minded engineers in an environment that has fantastic perks, including an annual ski trip, yoga, a competitive foosball league, and copious amounts of yogurt.
